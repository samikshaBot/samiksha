# Trade Credit Marketplace

## Project Description

The Trade Credit Marketplace is a blockchain-based smart contract platform built on the Stellar Soroban network that enables small businesses to issue and manage trade credit tokens to other businesses. This decentralized solution facilitates peer-to-peer business credit transactions, providing an alternative to traditional financing methods by allowing businesses to extend credit directly to their partners and suppliers.

The smart contract provides a transparent, immutable, and efficient system for tracking trade credit issuance and redemption between business entities. Each trade credit is represented as a unique token with complete audit trail information including issuer, recipient, amount, and redemption status.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize B2B financing by creating a decentralized trade credit ecosystem that:

- **Empowers Small Businesses**: Provides small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with flexible financing options without relying on traditional banking institutions
- **Builds Trust**: Leverages blockchain transparency to create verifiable credit histories and strengthen business relationships
- **Enhances Liquidity**: Enables businesses to convert trade credits into liquid assets through a peer-to-peer marketplace
- **Reduces Costs**: Eliminates intermediaries and reduces transaction costs associated with traditional credit systems
- **Promotes Financial Inclusion**: Makes business credit accessible to companies that may not qualify for conventional financing

By digitizing trade credits on the blockchain, we aim to create a more inclusive and efficient business financing ecosystem where trust is built through transparency and creditworthiness is verifiable on-chain.
